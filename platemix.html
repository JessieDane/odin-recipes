    <p class="text">This is the recipe for making platemix. This is a dish with which you can go in nearly every direction to you heart's liking.
    I discovered this dish because i found myself <em>consistently</em> having scrap pieces of vegetables.
    There is not much to tell about this dish, so let's just get to it! 
    </p>

    <h3> what you need for to make platemix</h3>

    <ul class="list">
        <li>potato slices or cubes</li>
        <li>fish fillet steak</li>
        <li>pieces of paprika</li>
        <li>pieces of cucumber</li>
        <li>couple of pickles</li>
        <li>feta cheese</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>spatula or 2</li>
        <li>frying pan, 2 is recommended</li>
        <li>cutting board and appropriate cutting knives</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>

    <ol class="list">
        <li>cut the fish in the desired cubes/pieces</li>
        <li>cut the paprika and cucumber in pieces of about 1cm</li>
        <li>cut the pickles in slices and break up the feta into crumbles, but keep them separate from the paprika and cucumber.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Now that everything is cut and prepared it's time to heat up the frying pans</p>

    <ol class="list">
        <li>put the butter into the frying pans</li>
        <li>put the potato cubes or slices in 1 frying pan and bake them well</li>
        <li>put the fish in the other frying pan and bake it, but at a slightly lower fire.</li>
        <li>when the potato's are nearly done put the paprika and cucumber in the same pan as the potato's and let them heat for a moment (1-2 min) </li>
        <li>when both the fish and the potato's are done, put them all together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>put the pickle pieces in with it, and sprinkle the bowl with feta crumbs</li>
        <li>now it is time to dine like the gods themselves!</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="note">You can add sauce and/or spices to this dish to your liking. I prefer ketchup and a spice mix called "melange de France".</p>
