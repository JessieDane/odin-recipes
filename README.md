# odin-recipes

starting note.
Okay, here we are! the assignment of the html-basics of the odin project!
i've had to take a couple days off for some much needed maintenance on my residence.
i am lately more interested in taking a conscience stance toward my diet, so i probably will expand these later on.
now, onward to the assignment!
i must admit that using git escapes me at the moment, so i have to go a bit back and forth, but we learn by doing.

my assignment is to create a recipe book from scratch using html.
it should consist of an index, and 3 pages in which the recipes will be explained.

in this assignment i will demonstrate; using the terminal efficiently, using git to push my assignment to github, creating the index (i will not use the boilerplate, but type it manually), creating 
the recipe pages and linking those to the index, manipulating the text within those pages, and have pictures diplayed on my recipe pages.

Mid note.
i have made the pages, i've tried to fix typo's and errors on the way, but i will proof read it all definitively at the end.
i didn't get the img links (with the exception of the odin logo on the index) to work for some reason, which i will see to at a later moment.

End note.
i still don't know why the img links did't work, but i rewrote the img links and they work now.

final thoughts.
it was a fun assignment to do, it went better then i thought i could handle.
however, in hindsight i should have went with the 'suggestion' recipes instead of making my own.
i could have finished this way faster if i didn't had the creativity hill to climb.
i also didn't follow the assignment to the letter, i had the idea and just went with it.
again it was fun, it refreshed my mind about git aswel, which escaped me at the start.

-----------------
css exercise.

starting note.
in this exercise i need to style the recipe pages using the external method of using css.
learning from my previous mistake,the actual style isn't important, this isn't a fashion competition. i do need to demonstrate i can add and work with css to a basic degree.

Jessie D.

end note.
i couldn't get to work a specific piece of text in different color.
i eventually circumvented the issue by giving it it's own designation.
i did also put in some "<!-notes->" to explain why i kept certain inconsistenties.

Jessie D.

final thoughts.
rewarding, but i do need more time spend on figuring out the cascade of css.
i understand the principle, but in practise this hasn't settled yet.

css exercise 2.
in this final css exercise i need to finish styling with css and work with the box models.
block-boxes, inline-boxes or a combo of them.
i do feel that the previous lessons were too much read-heavy and far less do-heavy and it didn't really settle in just yet, as evident by the previous assignment.
i do understand the principles behind it, but i'm not really well known with the tools i have at my disposal and the options they bring.
after this i hope to have a better feel for it.
let's get to it!
