# odin-recipes

Okay, here we are! the assignment of the html-basics of the odin project!
i've had to take a couple days off for some much needed maintenance on my residence.
i am lately more interested in taking a conscience stance toward my diet, so i probably will expand these later on.
now, onward to the assignment!
i must admit that using git escapes me at the moment, so i have to go a bit back and forth, but we learn by doing.

my assignment is to create a recipe book from scratch using html.
it should consist of an index, and 3 pages in which the recipes will be explained.

in this assignment i will demonstrate; using the terminal efficiently, using git to push my assignment to github, creating the index (i will not use the boilerplate, but type it manually), creating 
the recipe pages and linking those to the index, manipulating the text within those pages, and have pictures diplayed on my recipe pages.
