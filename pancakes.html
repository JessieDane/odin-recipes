    <p>this is a recipe for making Dutch pancakes.
       if you are used to American pancakes, then you will find these are much thinner.
       you will also find that these are much easier to add different things to them, such as bacon, apple slices, pineapple.
       but you can also enjoy them plain and simple.
       they are often eaten with a syrup or powdered sugar, but it is also not uncommon to add a chocolate spread like nuttela to them.
       you can go almost <em>any</em> direction with them!
    </p>
    
    <h3> What you need to make about 9 pancakes :</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>250g of flour</li>
        <li>500ml milk</li>
        <li>8g sugar, regular or vanilla</li>
        <li>slices or cubes of bacon</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>a frying pan, it can be done with higher edges, but i advise edges as low as possible</li>
        <li>a large bowl or pot to mix in</li>
        <li>a mixer or a whisk</li>
        <li>a ladle, preferably one to scoop soup</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The mixture</h3> 
    <ol>
        <li>Bake the bacon well through, and put it to the side.</li>
        <li>break an egg into the large bowl and add half of the flour and half of the milk with it.</li>
        <li>mix it all together, and when it is in a more liquid state add the rest of the previous materials and keep mixing.</li>
        <li>add the sugar, and mix it all thorough until there are no more clumps in the mixture</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Now that the bacon and the mixture is ready, we can begin to actually bake the pancakes</p>
    <p> <strong>note: having your frying pan as hot as possible before you start pouring the mixture in yields the best results!</strong> </p>
    <ol>
        <li>butter your frying pan regularly, every couple or so pancakes, liquid butter works best for me</li>
        <li>sprinkle some of the bacon around in your frying pan.</li>
        <li>use your ladle to scoop up some mixture.</li>
        <li>gently pour the mixture in the middle of your frying pan.</li>
        <li>wiggle your frying pan a bit around to get the mixture spread evenly around and hold the bacon.</li>
        <li>when the surface of the pancake is dry [1-2 min], you have to flip it upside down*</li>
        <li>after flipping it over, bake it for another minute or so</li>
        <li>after that, slide it unto a plate and keep another plate upside down on top to keep it warm.</li>
        <li>repeat until you are out of mixture</li>
        <li><strong>voila!</strong> you have made dutch pancakes, now you get to enjoy eating them!</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong>* if you are feeling courageous, you can flip the pancake over with the frying pan itself, by whipping it up.
        it is a high risk, high reward trade off tho, because it is great when it works out, but if you miss catching it, well, the dog will have a nice treat ^^
